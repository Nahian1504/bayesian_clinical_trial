# Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP)


## Objective

The primary objective of this clinical trial is to evaluate the efficacy of various tumor characteristics in predicting the diagnosis of breast cancer. Specifically, we aim to assess the relationship between tumor features and the likelihood of a malignant diagnosis.

Statistical Methods

    Descriptive Statistics:
        Summary statistics (mean, median, standard deviation) will be calculated for continuous variables (e.g., radius_mean, area_mean).
        Frequency counts will be provided for categorical variables (e.g., diagnosis).

    Frequentist Analysis:
        A logistic regression model will be fitted to assess the relationship between tumor characteristics and the diagnosis of breast cancer.
        The model will include the following predictors: radius_mean, texture_mean, perimeter_mean, area_mean, smoothness_mean, compactness_mean, concavity_mean, concave_points_mean, symmetry_mean, and fractal_dimension_mean.

    Bayesian Analysis:
        A Bayesian logistic regression model will be fitted using the brms package.
        Prior distributions will be specified for the model parameters, and posterior distributions will be estimated.

    Model Comparison:
        The results of the frequentist and Bayesian models will be compared using appropriate metrics (e.g., AIC, BIC, posterior predictive checks).

Sample Size Calculation

A sample size of 200 patients will provide 80% power to detect a significant difference at a 5% significance level, assuming a two-sided test. This calculation is based on an expected effect size derived from previous studies.
Data Handling

    All data will be de-identified to protect patient confidentiality.
    Data will be stored securely and accessed only by authorized personnel.

Limitations

    The analysis may be limited by the quality and completeness of the data.
    Potential confounding variables not included in the model may affect the results.
