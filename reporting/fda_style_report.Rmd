# Introduction


This report presents the results of a Bayesian clinical trial analysis comparing the frequentist and Bayesian models. The analysis aims to evaluate the effectiveness of the treatment based on clinical trial data.


# Methods


## Data Loading


The models used in this analysis are loaded from saved RDS files. The frequentist model is fitted using logistic regression, while the Bayesian model is fitted using a Bayesian approach.


```{r setup, include=FALSE}

# Load necessary libraries

library(gt)

library(gtsummary)

library(brms)  

library(knitr)  

# Load the freq model with error handling

if (file.exists("E:/bayesian_clinical_trial/modeling/frequentist_model.rds")) {

  freq_model <- readRDS("E:/bayesian_clinical_trial/modeling/frequentist_model.rds")

} else {

  stop("The file 'frequentist_model.rds' does not exist.")

}


# Load the Bayesian model with error handling

if (file.exists("E:/bayesian_clinical_trial/modeling/bayesian_model.rds")) {

  bayes_model <- readRDS("E:/bayesian_clinical_trial/modeling/bayesian_model.rds")

} else {

  stop("The file 'bayesian_model.rds' does not exist.")

}

```

# Model Summaries

```


```{r eda-plot2, echo=FALSE}

```


```{r eda-plot3, echo=FALSE}

# Conclusion

In this report, we presented the results of the frequentist and Bayesian models. The comparison of the coefficients provides insights into the effectiveness of the treatment. Further analysis and validation are recommended to confirm these findings.
